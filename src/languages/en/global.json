    "sobre-nosotros-1": "Founded in the year 2000, it is a network of people and spaces; passionate about architecture, research and experimentation. A 'studio' more than an office, where research is always present, favoring the change of paradigms; a space more than a place, for the search for opportunities through a flow of resources, collaborations and time. A work process more than a way of working, based on the formulation of strategies, observation, juxtaposition of information, practice and knowledge. Ask, design, materialize, and verify as an attitude.",
    "sobre-nosotros-2": "Research and innovation are present in our study, participating in projects that seek new solutions to apply them in real cases. We believe in networks of transdisciplinary professionals aimed at obtaining the best result for a project; and for this reason we are committed to open innovation, collaboration and knowledge sharing.",
    "equipo": "We are architects, urban planners and designers, with international experience, and participation in teaching and research. We work in the areas of architecture, interior design, interventions in historical sites, urban design and planning, landscape, ephemeral exhibitions, theory and criticism.

      "DA0008": "Single-family home on the edge of urban land and in front of a space of high ecological value. The project compacts the building area, freeing up most of the plot and blurs the volume, reducing the reading of its height and presence. The house is bright, in direct relation with the natural space that surrounds it.",
      "DA0056": "Logistics and office building. Modular and prefabricated construction improving its implementation. The offices on the main façade are integrated into the enclosure material, being protected by a metallic brisesoleil that allows an industrial scale in the materials and domestic solutions for the user.",

The dining room, living room and professional study open to the surrounding vegetation with diagonal visuals, incorporating the space into the interior. The heights of the spaces, their compactness or their transparency propose different ways of living them, but only the use that the family that inhabits them makes of them gives them meaning. Sharing a breakfast with them gives final meaning to the whole project and turns matter into feelings.",

XIX. The original business with a large corner façade was used as a famous jewelry store for the new bourgeoisie of the city. The glass-enclosed display cases and coffered ceilings inside conveyed the luxury of the silver and jewelry trade. The project transformed the commercial use to that of the new property “Gran Café Zaragoza” which would later remain as “Café 1885”. The interior rooms are cleaned of curtains, giving greater prominence to the cast iron columns and the elaborate coffered ceilings.

The University of Vic, the Vic City Council and the Board of Trustees of the Hospital de la Santa Creu, as the owner of the building, have been involved in the process during the almost 14 years that the entire intervention has lasted. The building was in a poor state of conservation, but it presented a constructive richness and high-quality architectural spaces, including a neoclassical cloister, 24 baroque vaults and high-quality paintings. The cloister and all the circulations around it have been recovered. The restorative spirit has led us to recover or repair the well-preserved existing carpentry, improving thermal behavior.

The entire architectural complex is baroque and neoclassical transition. A room attached to the church of Gothic origin with large pointed arches originally belonging to the Hospital de la Santa Creu is restored and incorporated into the use of the auditorium.

As local architects, in collaboration with Zaha Hadid Arch., we have experimented with the design of architectural spaces, innovative structural solutions and new materials, which serve as a reference for the renovation of a century-old family winery. The result has added new values related to the traditional culture of 'Viña Tondonia'. The reception building houses the exhibition pavilion that Viña Tondonia showed at the 1910 fair.

This Center is built on the historic Montcada i Reixac water mine, which feeds the 'Rec Comtal' from a Roman waterway parallel to the Besós river. Therefore, the project had to grow vertically and it was resolved with the creation of a new floor on the existing roof, which visually opened the building up to the natural environment that surrounds it.

The project emerges from the landscape like a nameless and timeless old fortress. We imagine the library as an enveloping shelter of books, a building full of luminous, solitary or collective corners, where one can find both the calm of reading and the stimulation of meeting and exchanging ideas. The interior spaces are not rectangular, but polygons with 5 or 6 sides. Thus, with the shelves we can create spaces that surround the reader without restricting their movements, and increasing storage capacity by up to 50%. The park is part of the building and the park building, related to the interior and exterior spaces. The roofs blend visually with the park and, due to their staggering, reveal the distant view of the Monastery of Sant Cugat, so present in the municipality, and with whom the library will keep a formal and conceptual resonance. Contemporary is compatible with Historical.",
