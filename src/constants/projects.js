The University of Vic, the Vic City Council and the Board of Trustees of the Hospital de la Santa Creu, as the owner of the building, have been involved in the process during the almost 14 years that the entire intervention has lasted. The building was in a poor state of conservation, but it presented a constructive richness and high-quality architectural spaces, including a neoclassical cloister, 24 baroque vaults and high-quality paintings. The cloister and all the circulations around it have been recovered. The restorative spirit has led us to recover or repair the well-preserved existing carpentry, improving thermal behavior. Most of the wooden structures and the 24 existing vaults have also been preserved, repairing or reinforcing. After the Restoration the Building has been declared BCIL (Cultural Asset of Local Interest).",

      "New building for the Gabriel Ferrater Library in the Ramon Barnils park in Sant Cugat del Vallès. 3rd prize project competition. The project emerges from the landscape like a nameless and timeless old fortress. We imagine the library as an enveloping shelter of books, a building full of luminous, solitary or collective corners, where one can find both the calm of reading and the stimulation of meeting and exchanging ideas. The interior spaces are not rectangular, but polygons with 5 or 6 sides. Thus, with the shelves we can create spaces that surround the reader without restricting their movements, and increasing storage capacity by up to 50%. The park is part of the building and the park building, related to the interior and exterior spaces. The roofs blend visually with the park and, due to their staggering, reveal the distant view of the Monastery of Sant Cugat, so present in the municipality, and with whom the library will keep a formal and conceptual resonance. Contemporary is compatible with Historical.",
